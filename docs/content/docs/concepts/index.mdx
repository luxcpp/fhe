# FHE Concepts

Understanding the fundamental concepts behind Fully Homomorphic Encryption is essential for effective use of lux-fhe.

## Overview

Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables computation on encrypted data without decryption. This section covers the theoretical foundations and practical considerations.

## Topics

### [Homomorphic Encryption](/docs/concepts/homomorphic-encryption)
Introduction to homomorphic encryption, its properties, and how it enables privacy-preserving computation.

### [Bootstrapping](/docs/concepts/bootstrapping)
The key technique that makes FHE "fully" homomorphic by refreshing ciphertexts and reducing noise.

### [Noise Management](/docs/concepts/noise-management)
Understanding and managing noise growth in FHE computations to maintain correctness.

### [Security](/docs/concepts/security)
Security foundations of lattice-based cryptography and parameter selection guidelines.

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Plaintext** | Unencrypted data in its original form |
| **Ciphertext** | Encrypted data that can be computed on |
| **Noise** | Random error added during encryption for security |
| **Bootstrapping** | Operation to reduce noise and enable unlimited computations |
| **Multiplicative Depth** | Number of sequential multiplications before bootstrapping needed |
| **Ring Dimension** | Size of polynomial ring (power of 2), affects security and performance |
| **Modulus** | Large integer defining the coefficient space |

## Scheme Selection Guide

| Use Case | Recommended Scheme | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Boolean circuits | TFHE | Fast bootstrapping, native binary ops |
| Integer arithmetic | BGV/BFV | Exact computation, batching |
| Machine learning | CKKS | Approximate arithmetic, real numbers |
| Privacy-preserving search | TFHE | Comparison operations |
| Statistical analysis | CKKS | Floating-point operations |
